# etch-a-sketch

This is a small project that was made as a exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

This took me longer than I thought but it is worth it at the end.

I will try to add more features and fix some bugs (If there are some)

## Planned features
- âœ… Add mobile support.
- Add some small features here and there. (Like changing the cursor according to the user current tool.) 

## Contact me
The best way to reach out to me is via discord. ðŸ˜‰
